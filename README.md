# Youtube-Spam-Deleter
A clone of ThioJoe's Youtube [spam deleter](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge) but with GUI.

**Note:** checkout [thiojoe's spam deleter](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge). I made a similiar version of that but also implemented a GUI system

Check out his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vOakOgYLUI) on his app

# Running
You will need to have python3 for this app to run. After you install python, run `python3 main.py`(Linux/Mac) or `python main.py`(Windows)

# Setup
For setup you follow [ThioJoe's](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge#user-content-instructions---obtaining-youtube-api-key) for the app but in step no. 12 instead of selecting `Desktop App`, select `Web application`, and then add `http://localhost:8080` in the URI field.
